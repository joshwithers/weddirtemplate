The Elopement Collective is a team of esteemed wedding industry experts dedicated to crafting unforgettable elopements for rebellious, creative, and wildly passionate couples. With a presence in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Canberra, Hobart, Darwin, Gold Coast–Tweed Heads, Newcastle, and the Sunshine Coast, we have earned a reputation as the go-to choice for couples seeking a unique and personalised wedding experience.  

Led by the dynamic husband and wife duo, Josh and Britt, who initially founded The Pop-Up Wedding Co., our mission is to celebrate love and commitment in a way that feels authentic and deeply personal. We believe that elopements should be an intimate reflection of your love story, allowing you to exchange vows surrounded by a select few of your closest family members or even just as a duo, with us as your witnesses.  

Our approach to elopement is simple yet profound: we specialise in creating elopements, not traditional weddings. This focus allows us to curate heartfelt and bespoke moments for you and your partner, ensuring that your day is a true celebration of your love.  

We collaborate with the finest celebrants, photographers, videographers, and florists in the industry, bringing together a talented group of individuals who share a singular vision for your elopement. Each member of our collective is committed to making your special day not only memorable but also seamlessly executed, allowing you to focus entirely on your love and the promises you are making to one another.  

Trust The Elopement Collective to turn your dream elopement into a stunning reality.
